    <p>App is only required by Apple to make the extension work. It does not do anything in itself.</p>
    <p>Enable the extension in safari, then you should get a permission request when going to ikea.com and clicking the app icon in the toolbar. After this, you can hide the icon permanently.</p>
    
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
